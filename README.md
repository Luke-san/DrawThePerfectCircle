Someone challenged me to beat his score in the draw the perfect circle site. I wasn't interested in practicing for weeks on end but I also wanted to crush his soul so I wrote this up.

This was my first time I utilized user32.dll in any project so that will be in the very least interesting to see how it will come of use in future projects.

To use this you just run it, go to the tab where you want to draw the circle and press the spacebar.

At first the program scored up to 99.5%, but now it will achive me 99.9%

This program is hard-coded for 1920x1080 monitors, it will not work on monitors with smaller or larger resolutions without modification.
