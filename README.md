Someone challenged me to beat his score in the draw the perfect circle site. I wasn't interested in practicing for weeks on end but I also wanted to crush his soul so I wrote this up.

This was my first time I utilized user32.dll in any project so that will be in the very least interesting to see how it will come of use in future projects.

To use this you just run it, go to the tab where you want to draw the circle, press the spacebar and immediately after hold down the left mouse button.

At most I got 99.5%, but usually you get 99.4%. I am not too interested in going for a better score so I will leave it at that.
